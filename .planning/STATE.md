## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Full decision log for v1.0 is in `.planning/PROJECT.md` Key Decisions table, `.planning/RETROSPECTIVE.md`, and `.planning/milestones/v1.0-ROADMAP.md`. Cleared here at milestone close — starts fresh for the next milestone.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

Carried forward from v1.0 close (still open, relevant to next milestone):

- Backend migration is the planned next milestone — real backend (Node.js/Express/PostgreSQL recommended), server-side auth (bcrypt/JWT), and genuine multi-user concurrent support are all currently in `PROJECT.md`'s Out of Scope, to be moved to Active when the next milestone is scoped.
- DESIGN-04/Phase 5's "no visual regression" claims were verified structurally, not pixel-confirmed in a real browser (no `chromium-cli`/Playwright available). Recommend one manual browser pass over Landing/Login/Register/Dashboard/ManajemenKota/KeputusanDistribusi before building further UI on top.
- v2 candidate: Login.jsx's "Lupa Password?" and "Ingat saya" controls remain non-functional by deliberate decision — revisit once a real backend exists (the former needs server-side infra; the latter needs real session-expiry logic).
- v2 deferred: TEST-01 (automated tests for `distribusi.js`/`forecast.js`) and SEC-01 (CSV injection review for user-entered city names) — see `.planning/milestones/v1.0-REQUIREMENTS.md` for original context.
