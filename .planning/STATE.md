# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-21)

**Core value:** The app must feel complete and trustworthy end-to-end for every role — every page works, every action persists and reflects instantly, and nothing looks unfinished or inconsistent.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Admin City & Stock Management

## Current Position

Phase: 2 — Role-Differentiated Reporting
Plan: Not started
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-06-21 — Phase 1 complete, transitioned to Phase 2

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Phases 1-4 derived directly from research/SUMMARY.md's proposed structure (additive Admin CRUD, Laporan role-dispatcher fix, validation sweep, auth/landing design unification); confirmed against requirements with no changes needed.
- Roadmap: AUDIT-01 kept as a standalone Phase 5 (not folded into a neighbor) because it depends on Phases 1-4 all being complete before it can audit the full app — it cannot run concurrently with them.
- [Phase 01]: Cities remain keyed by nama (string) — no synthetic id field introduced, matching existing store.js contract — Plan 01-01 (Manajemen Kota scaffold)
- [Phase 01]: Add/Edit/Delete/Stock-edit actions rendered as no-op placeholders in plan 01-01 to lock in final page layout before CRUD wiring in plans 02/03 — Avoids layout churn when real handlers are wired

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1: City rename/delete-with-existing-references behavior (block/cascade/warn) is an open product decision — must be resolved explicitly during `/gsd-discuss-phase` for Phase 1, not left implicit (per research/SUMMARY.md).
- Phase 1: Confirm whether `utils/distribusi.js`'s recommendation engine reads `getStokTbs()` directly or via a passed argument, so the new stock editor doesn't bypass whatever read path it uses.
- Phase 2: Exact field/metric selection for each role's Laporan fork needs to be resolved during phase discussion against `StatusDistribusi.jsx`'s and `KeputusanDistribusi.jsx`'s actual data shapes.
- Phase 4: Risk of scope drift into a visual redesign rather than a swap-in-place onto existing shared components — treat as same content/layout, different implementation, and regression-check every other page that consumes any shared component touched during this work.
- v2 deferred: TEST-01 (automated tests for `distribusi.js`/`forecast.js`) and SEC-01 (CSV injection sanitization review for user-entered city names) are tracked in REQUIREMENTS.md v2 section, not in this milestone's scope.
